## Description

Out of our passion to solve the issue of time waste in the robot creation process, ARC was born. The ARC software platform reduces the time it takes to get from idea to implementation. Since 2011 we have been listening to the challenges robot builders encounter and continue to provide them with an ever expanding toolbox of solutions. Join us on this journey!

We didn't stop at the software, we also made time saving hardware solutions. This GPS design is one of them. This is a ez-clip mounting option for the Waveshare GPS NEO-7M-C module. A unique feature of this design is that it allows the GPS antenna to keep pointing skyward while the module is mounted onto a vertical connection. We want to share these files with you so you can create your own version for your community and customers to enjoy!

**Features:**
- UART communication
- On-board GPS antenna
- PPS pin broken out
- Backup battery and EEPROM
- 3.3V voltage regulator 
- Red status LED
- Voltage requirements: 3.2-5V (3.3V typical)
- Current draw: 78mA
- Dimensions: 25.5(W) x 35.3(L) x 37.5(H) (mm)
- Weight: 20g

**Major components:** 
- NEO-7M-C GPS module

**Manufacturing notes:** 
1. Manufacturer: Dual side placement and soldering of PCBs
